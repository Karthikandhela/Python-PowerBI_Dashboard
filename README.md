# Python-PowerBI_Dashboard
The primary aim of this project is to analyze publicly available data on Netflix viewership to identify trends and preferences among audiences. By understanding which genres and content types resonate most with viewers, the project seeks to provide actionable insights to enhance audience engagement and optimize content strategies. Ultimately, this analysis will support Netflix in increasing viewership, driving higher user retention, and boosting revenue by achieving the targeted percentage growth.
I utilized Python libraries such as **NumPy** and **pandas** to perform extensive data cleaning and transformation Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset. Handled null values in alignment with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) specified, ensuring data integrity Extracted additional columns from existing ones to derive new insights after completing the data cleaning and transformation. I saved the processed data in a CSV file Imported this cleaned data into **Power BI** for building insightful and visually compelling reports. Built dynamic dashboards using DAX functions to analyze key metrics and trends. Designed navigation buttons to enable seamless movement between different report pages, enhancing user experience.
Through in-depth analysis of the dataset, several key trends and patterns were identified. Trend analysis- Analyzed the year-wise trend for movies and shows, observing an increase in content production and viewership over time. Used geographical data to determine the countries and regions with the highest viewership, allowing for a deeper understanding of market preferences. Investigated which genres are most popular among viewers, providing insights into audience preferences. Analyzed titles with higher ratings to understand the characteristics of successful content. Identified top-performing actors and directors using dax functions highlighting the key contributors to successful productions. Determined the top genres that consistently attract high viewership and ratings.
